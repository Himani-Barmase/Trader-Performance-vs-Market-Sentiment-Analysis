# 📊 Trader Performance vs. Market Sentiment Analysis

This project explores the relationship between **trader performance** and the **market's Fear & Greed sentiment index**, aiming to uncover hidden behavioral patterns and derive actionable insights for smarter trading strategies.

---

## 🚀 Objective

To investigate how traders' profitability (PnL) and behavior (buy/sell volume, positions) vary under different market sentiment conditions (Fear, Neutral, Greed) using historical trade data merged with sentiment scores.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**  
- **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Data Cleaning & EDA**  
- **Time Series Analysis**

---

## 🧩 Dataset

- **Trades Dataset**: Includes transaction details like side (Buy/Sell), size, PnL, timestamps, etc.
- **Fear & Greed Index**: Daily sentiment score ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed).
- **Merged Dataset**: Both datasets joined on the date column for integrated analysis.

---

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- Fear & Greed Index over time  
- Average PnL vs. Sentiment classification  
- Trade Volume vs. Sentiment  
- Buy vs. Sell frequency under different sentiments  
- PnL distribution per sentiment type  
- Classification-wise trader performance

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **High Greed periods** often align with **lower average PnL**, suggesting overconfidence leads to losses.
- **Fear periods** saw more cautious trading but occasionally higher PnL due to volatility.
- **Buy vs. Sell behavior** shifted significantly under Greed, with increased Buy trades.
- **Sentiment classification** plays a role in position sizing and execution trends.
